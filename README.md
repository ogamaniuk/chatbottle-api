### What is ChatBottle?
[ChatBottle](https://chatbottle.co/?ref=github) is a tool to discover the best chatbots. It's like App Store or Google, but for chatbots.

You probably know thousands of developers are working on bots right now. In a few months, the market will be crowded and it will be much more difficult to find a chatbot. ChatBottle is one more channel to drive traffic to your bot. Integrate your bots with the API to join the club.
Whenever a bot receives or sends a message ChatBottle is notified. It allows to gather the data and measure how people actually use the bot. 
Based on the collected data ChatBottle ranks the bots.

### What is the Developer Platform?
The ChatBottle Developer Platform is a way for anyone to integrate their bot to ChatBottle. There are two main reasons for integrating:

1. ChatBottle BotStore drives a high-quality audience to you bot.
2. So that you can learn how your bots are used, review analytics and setup metrics.

Integrating with ChatBottle is easy and should take a developer about a few minutes. What you need to do is just to forward sent and received messages to ChatBottle REST API.  

### Why to integrate with ChatBottle?

ChatBottle is one more customer acquisition channel to drive traffic to your bot. Integration with ChatBottle allows to get news users and  return existing ones.

Promoting a chatbot with ChatBottle is cheaper than advertising, content marketing or SEO. Once the bot is integrated it will be automatically ranked and listed in ChatBottle BotStore.

### How it works?
Your bot forwards every message it sent or received to ChatBottle API. The messages are analyzed by our ranking algorithms and the bot is ranked. 
ChatBottle bot rank works similar to Google PageRank. It’s important how people interact with a chatbot, how often and how helpful is the bot.

ChatBottle ranks bots based on retention and other metrics. Having not many but addicted users is a good sign for ChatBottle algorithms. As a result, your bot is ranked higher and more people find out about it.

It’s important to integrate with ChatBottle as early as possible. Even before the official launch of a bot. ChatBottle algorithms need some data to properly measure and rank your bot. We recommend starting using the API at least a week before actual public launch.

## Getting Started
This is a simplified walkthrough to see the platform in action. Read the [API Guide](https://github.com/chatbottle/chatbottle-api#api) to learn about the features in more detail. Use curl to run the following code snippets.

1. Register at [chatbottle.co](https://chatbottle.co).
2. Create a bot at the dashboard
3. Enable chatbot platform. Messenger and Telegram are supported today.
4. Every time your bots send or received a message call ChatBottle Updates API. Use generated **Authorization token** and **ChatBottle Bot Id** to make calls like this:
```
curl -v https://api.chatbottle.co/v1/updates/[chatbottle bot id] \
-H "Authorization: [token]" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "Messaging": [
  
    {
      "Id": "712329970",
      "Text": "Hello world!",
      "UserId": "1646261728",
      "Direction": "Out"
    }    
  ]
}
'
```


## API

### Schema
All API access is over HTTPS, and accessed from the `https://api.chatbottle.co`. All data is sent and received as JSON.

### Root Endpoint
You can issue a GET request to the root endpoint to get all the endpoint categories that the API supports:
```
curl https://api.chatbottle.co
```
### Client Errors
There are three possible types of client errors on API calls that receive request bodies:
- Sending invalid JSON will result in a 400 Bad Request response.


### Authentication
There are three ways to authenticate through ChatBottle API. Requests that require authentication will return `403 Forbidden` and `401 Unauthorized.`
#### HMAC Authentication(sent in a header)
```
curl -H "Authorization: OAUTH-TOKEN" https://api.chatbottle.co

```

#### HMAC Authentication (sent as a parameter)
```
curl https://api.chatbottle.co/?token=OAUTH-TOKEN
```

This should only be used in server to server scenarios. Don't leak your authentification token to your users.
